# FPGAController
An android application controller for a FPGA connected RC Vehicle utilizing device accelerometer and bluetooth connectivity.

## Hardware Specifications
The FPGA model used for this project is the [Nexys3 Spartan-6 board] (http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,400,897&Prod=NEXYS3&CFID=16667609&CFTOKEN=56aeca82b5997c0b-B29553AA-5056-0201-02BF35E158F053D1).
The repository for the Verilog code can be found [here] (https://github.com/EC551/LaserBeams).  A bluetooth pmod was utilized
as our wireless interface between the Android device and the FPGA board.
